excerpt: 'This paper is about a technical innovation in microvascular decompression (MVD) for hemifacial spasm involving the vertebral artery (VA). We described the “bridge-layered” decompression technique, which employs a multipoint “bridge” to elevate the VA and a layered approach to manage its branch vessels, aiming to minimize cerebellar traction and reduce the risk to the facial‑acoustic nerve complex.'
