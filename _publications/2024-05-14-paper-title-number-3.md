Abstract

Background: 
Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is most effectively treated with microvascular decompression (MVD). However, there are certain challenges in performing MVD for HFS when the vertebral artery (VA) is involved in compressing the facial nerve (VA-involved). This study aimed to introduce a “bridge-layered” decompression technique for treating patients with VA-involved HFS and to evaluate its efficacy and safety to treat patients with HFS.

Methods: 
A single-center retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 62 patients with VA-involved HFS. The tortuous trunk of VA was lifted by a multi-point “bridge” decompression technique to avoid excessive traction of the cerebellum and reduce the risk of damage to the facial-acoustic nerve complex. To fully decompress all the responsible vessels, the branch vessels of VA were then isolated using the “layered” decompression technique.

Results: 
Among the 62 patients, 59 patients were cured immediately after the surgery, two patients were delayed cured after two months, and one had occasional facial muscle twitching after the surgery. Patients were followed up for an average of 19.5 months. The long-term follow-up results showed that all patients had no recurrence of HFS during the follow-up period, and no patients developed hearing loss, facial paralysis, or other permanent neurological damage complications. Only two patients developed tinnitus after the surgery.

Conclusion: 
The “bridge-layered” decompression technique could effectively treat VA-involved HFS with satisfactory safety and a low risk of hearing loss. The technique could be used as a reference for decompression surgery for VA-involved HFS.
