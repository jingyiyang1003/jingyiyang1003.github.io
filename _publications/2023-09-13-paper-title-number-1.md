excerpt: 'This paper is about a case-matched MRI study demonstrating that trigeminal neuralgia patients with vertebrobasilar compression exhibit an enlarged cerebellopontine angle cistern on the affected side, frequently associated with vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia and junction laterality. These anatomical alterations may contribute to nerve compression through a distinct pathophysiological mechanism.'

Abstract
---
Previous studies have indicated that the small cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern plays a role in the pathogenesis of trigeminal neuralgia (TN), but they are likely not involved in TN associated with vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) compression because of its rarity. Forty-four patients with VBA-associated TN and 44 age-, sex-, and hypertension-matched TN patients without VBA compression (non-VBA-associated) were included. All patients underwent high-resolution MRI. The CPA cistern volumes were measured bilaterally. The presence of vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia (VBD) and laterality of the vertebrobasilar junction (VBJ) were observed. The CPA cistern volume on the affected side was smaller than the unaffected side (714.4 ± 372.8 vs 890.2 ± 462.2 mm3, p < 0.001) in non-VBA-associated TN patients, while VBA-associated TN patients show a larger CPA cistern on the affected side than the unffected side (1107.0 ± 500.5 vs 845.3 ± 314.8 mm3, p < 0.001). The prevalence of VBD was higher in patients with VBA-associated TN than in matched non-VBA-associated TN patients (90.9% vs 4.5%, p < 0.001). A positive correlation between the laterality of VBJ and the affected side was found in the VBA-associated TN group (p < 0.0001). Large CPA cistern may be a neuroradiological feature of VBA-associated TN, and most of the VBA-associated TN is accompanied by VBD. The presence of VBD and the lateral shift of VBJ may expand the CPA cistern by squeezing the surrounding tissue on the affected side and also increase the chance of VBA compression on the trigeminal nerve, resulting in the genesis of VBA-associated TN.
